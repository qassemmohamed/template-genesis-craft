Re: Demand for Payment

Dear {{recipientName}},

This letter serves as a formal demand for payment in the amount of {{amountOwed}} for {{serviceProvided}} provided on {{serviceDate}}.

Despite several previous attempts to resolve this matter, the payment remains outstanding. Please remit payment within {{paymentDays}} days of receipt of this letter.

If payment is not received by {{dueDate}}, I will have no choice but to pursue legal remedies, including filing a lawsuit to recover the amount owed plus additional costs.
